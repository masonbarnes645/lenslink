# LensLink

LensLink is a conceptual platform designed to connect professional photographers with potential clients. Users can create an account as either a photographer or a customer, unlocking tailored functionalities: photographers can build and manage their portfolios, while customers can explore portfolios and book sessions with their ideal photographer.

Though not fully functional, LensLink demonstrates scalability and integrates key technical concepts such as state management, database design, full CRUD operations, and UI/UX principles. This prototype showcases the foundation for a robust app that could facilitate seamless connections within the photography industry.
